# Deepgram Voice Keyboard for Linux

![alt text](image.png)

**Status**: Working prototype! Successfully types into applications on Wayland (KDE Plasma 25.10)

A system-level voice-to-text/dictation application for Ubuntu Linux using Deepgram's cloud STT API. Types wherever your cursor is - works across all applications on Wayland.

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from Debian Package (Recommended)

1. Download the latest `.deb` package from [Releases](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Voice-Typing-Ubuntu-App/releases)

2. Install:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i voice-keyboard_0.1.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f  # Fix dependencies if needed
```

3. Set your Deepgram API key:
```bash
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence
```

4. Run:
```bash
voice-keyboard-launcher --test-stt
```

Or launch from your application menu.

### Option 2: Build from Source

1. Set your Deepgram API key:
```bash
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
./run.sh --test-stt
```

The run script will automatically:
- Create a Python virtual environment (for future GUI components)
- Build the Rust application
- Run with proper privilege handling (sudo for keyboard creation, drops to user for audio)

### Building a Debian Package

Use the unified `package.sh` script for all package management:

```bash
# Build only
./package.sh

# Build and install
./package.sh install

# Build and reinstall (removes old version first)
./package.sh reinstall

# Update version and build
./package.sh update 0.2.0

# Update version and install
./package.sh update 0.2.0 --install

# Show help
./package.sh --help
```

See [PACKAGING.md](PACKAGING.md) for detailed packaging documentation.

## Validated

✓ Text input into Kate text editor on Wayland (KDE Plasma 25.10)
✓ Cloud-based STT via Deepgram API
✓ Real-time transcription with on-the-fly punctuation

## Roadmap

See [PROJECT_NOTES.md](PROJECT_NOTES.md) for the complete feature roadmap and project context.

### MVP Features (In Priority Order)

1. **Hotkey support** - Configurable activation key (default: F13), tap-to-start/tap-to-stop, with PTT option
2. **Microphone handling** - Device selection with persistent settings
3. **Model selection** - Starting with Deepgram, future: multiple cloud providers
4. **GUI** - Simple interface with system tray integration
5. **Type anywhere** - ✓ Works on Wayland across all applications
6. **API spend monitoring** - Track usage costs with hourly polling

### Future Enhancements

- Mic level monitoring with dB display and alerts
- Post-processing for transcriptions
- Custom dictionary/replacements
- Long-form STT with chunking for extended recordings

## Why This Project?

After a year of voice typing becoming my default input method, I needed an OS-level dictation solution that:
- Works with cloud STT APIs (not local inference)
- Types anywhere on Wayland (the critical technical hurdle)
- Supports quality real-time transcription with punctuation
- Provides cost visibility for API usage

This builds on [Deepgram's voice-keyboard-linux starter](https://github.com/deepgram/voice-keyboard-linux) which successfully solved the Wayland typing challenge.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Rust (core), Python (future GUI)
- **STT Provider**: Deepgram cloud API
- **OS**: Ubuntu 25.10 with KDE Plasma on Wayland
- **Audio**: PipeWire via CPAL
- **Input**: Virtual keyboard device via uinput
