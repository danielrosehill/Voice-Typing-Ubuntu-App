# Deepgram Voice Keyboard for Linux

![alt text](image.png)

**Status**: Working prototype! Successfully types into applications on Wayland (KDE Plasma 25.10)

A system-level voice-to-text/dictation application for Ubuntu Linux using Deepgram's cloud STT API. Types wherever your cursor is - works across all applications on Wayland.

## Quick Start

1. Set your Deepgram API key:
```bash
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
./run.sh --test-stt
```

The run script will automatically:
- Create a Python virtual environment (for future GUI components)
- Build the Rust application
- Run with proper privilege handling (sudo for keyboard creation, drops to user for audio)

## Validated

✓ Text input into Kate text editor on Wayland (KDE Plasma 25.10)
✓ Cloud-based STT via Deepgram API
✓ Real-time transcription with on-the-fly punctuation

## Roadmap

See [PROJECT_NOTES.md](PROJECT_NOTES.md) for the complete feature roadmap and project context.

### MVP Features (In Priority Order)

1. **Hotkey support** - Configurable activation key (default: F13), tap-to-start/tap-to-stop, with PTT option
2. **Microphone handling** - Device selection with persistent settings
3. **Model selection** - Starting with Deepgram, future: multiple cloud providers
4. **GUI** - Simple interface with system tray integration
5. **Type anywhere** - ✓ Works on Wayland across all applications
6. **API spend monitoring** - Track usage costs with hourly polling

### Future Enhancements

- Mic level monitoring with dB display and alerts
- Post-processing for transcriptions
- Custom dictionary/replacements
- Long-form STT with chunking for extended recordings

## Why This Project?

After a year of voice typing becoming my default input method, I needed an OS-level dictation solution that:
- Works with cloud STT APIs (not local inference)
- Types anywhere on Wayland (the critical technical hurdle)
- Supports quality real-time transcription with punctuation
- Provides cost visibility for API usage

This builds on [Deepgram's voice-keyboard-linux starter](https://github.com/deepgram/voice-keyboard-linux) which successfully solved the Wayland typing challenge.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Rust (core), Python (future GUI)
- **STT Provider**: Deepgram cloud API
- **OS**: Ubuntu 25.10 with KDE Plasma on Wayland
- **Audio**: PipeWire via CPAL
- **Input**: Virtual keyboard device via uinput
